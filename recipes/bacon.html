        <p>Also called Millionaire Bacon, this is the ultimate sweet-spicy bacon to serve at a brunch or buffet. 
            The maple glaze has just a kiss of spice, allowing the savory flavor of the bacon to shine.</p>
        <p>Would you realistically pay a million dollars for this bacon? Me neither.</p>
    <h3><img src="../images/ingredients.png" alt="Ingredients text"></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound thick sliced bacon</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and place an oven-safe baking rack on top.</li>
            <li>In a shallow dish, combine the brown sugar, maple syrup, water, black pepper, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Whisk together until sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Dip each slice of bacon in the glaze, coating it well, and lay on the baking rack.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Rotate the pan in the oven and continue cooking until the bacon is as brown and crispy as you like it. Exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of bacon. 
                In our oven, total cooking time was about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the oven and let the bacon cool on the rack for 15 minutes. Blot excess grease with paper towels and serve.</li>
        </ol>
