        <p>Another classic. If you really want to make the recipe delectable 
            sub the Canadian bacon for sausage patties.</p>
        <p>Eggs Benedict is a traditional American breakfast and brunch recipe that 
            originated in New York City. It consists of an English muffin, cut in half, 
            toasted, and topped with Canadian bacon, poached eggs, and classic 
            French Hollandaise sauce. </p>
    <h3><img src="../images/ingredients.png" alt="Ingredients text"></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices Canadian bacon or 4 sausage patties</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 English muffins</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Hollandaise Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice , or lime juice</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.
                (Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle).</li>
            <li>Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds.
                Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.</li>
            <li>Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.</li>
            <li>Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).</li>
            <li>Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup). Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup.</li>
            <li>Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute on each side.</li>
        </ol>
